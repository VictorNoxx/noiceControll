[![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-Alert%20Bot-blue)](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

A powerful Python-based noise monitoring system designed for server rooms, data centers, and remote hardware monitoring. This tool helps system administrators detect abnormal noise levels from server fans, hard drives, or other hardware components, sending instant alerts via Telegram when noise thresholds are exceeded.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Noise Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of ambient noise levels using system microphones
- **Multi-Device Support**: Monitors all available audio input devices simultaneously
- **Telegram Integration**: Instant alerts when noise levels exceed defined thresholds
- **User-friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use interface for monitoring and configuration
- **Hardware Diagnostics**: Help identify potential hardware issues through noise pattern detection
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (primary focus on Windows)

## üîß Technical Features

- Root Mean Square (RMS) calculation for accurate noise level measurement
- Configurable sampling rates and monitoring intervals
- Low system resource usage
- Customizable alert thresholds
- Historical data logging for trend analysis
- Background operation mode

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Connected microphone or audio input device
- Internet connection (for Telegram alerts)
- Telegram Bot Token (for notifications)

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/artickc/noiceControll.git
cd noiceControll
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure Telegram bot (optional):
   - Create a new bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   - Copy your bot token
   - Add token to configuration file

## üöÄ Usage

### GUI Mode
```bash
python noise_monitor_gui.py
```

### Command Line Mode
```bash
python noise_monitor.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
